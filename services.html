<h1>Weed Control</h1>
<p>Weeds of all kind share a common trait; they are a nuisance to any yard. That is just where the similarities end. Weed control requires both
knowledge to identify different types as well as the experience to know how to kill them. Careful application of the right chemicals can starve off weeds
while promoting healthy grass. Our weed control program covers the following most common weeds: grassy weeds, nutsedge, broadleaf and more. We specialize
in keeping weeds out of your sidewalks, flower beds, and driveways.</p>

<h1>Lawn Renovations</h1>
<p>From spot seeding, to renovations, we can get the job done with the right type of seed.  Aerification helps reduce compaction and promotes water and air movement in the soil, promoting healthy turf. Some of the lawn renovation services we offer include:</p>
